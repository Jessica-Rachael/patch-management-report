## **PATCH MANAGEMENT**



&nbsp;          Patch management is the process of updating software like apps, operating systems, or firmware to fix bugs, close security holes, and improve performance.

&nbsp;          It is just like updating your phones to fix issues or add some features, computers and systems in cybersecurity needs similar updates and these are called patches.

&nbsp;          It is the process of proactively identifying, testing, and deploying software updates that is patches to fix vulnerabilities and bugs in computer systems and applications.



#### **Process:**

  

1\. Asset inventory and discovery:

&nbsp;          Understanding all hardware, software and connected devices that needs to be patched.



2\. Vulnerability assessment and patch identification:

&nbsp;          Scan systems for known vulnerabilities and identify available patches from vendors.



3\. Patch  prioritization and risk and patch identification:

&nbsp;          Determine which patches are most critical based on the severity of vulnerabilities and their potential impact.



4\. Patch Testing and Validation: 

&nbsp;         Test patches in a non-production environment (e.g., a pilot group or sandbox) to ensure compatibility and prevent disruptions.



5\. Patch Deployment Process:  

&nbsp;         Roll out the validated patches to production systems, either manually or through automated tools.



6\. Verification and Continuous Monitoring:

&nbsp;        Confirm that patches have been successfully installed and continue to monitor systems for missing patches or new vulnerabilities.



7\. Documentation and Review:  

&nbsp;        Document the entire process, including patch application, test results, and any issues encountered, for compliance and continuous improvement. 



#### **Role of Patch Management in Maintaining System Security**



1\. Fixes vulnerabilities:

&nbsp;        Software often has some weaknesses called vulnerabilities and hackers try to exploit these to gain access. Patching these flaws closes the doors on attackers before they can strike.



2\. Prevents cyberattacks:

&nbsp;        By applying patches on time, you reduce the chances of malware or hackers breaking into your system.



3\. Protects business or user data:

&nbsp;        Patch management ensures that your data remains confidential and secure.



4\. Improve software stability and performance:

&nbsp;        Patches often include fixes for bugs and errors that can cause crashes or slow down systems.



5\. Ensure compliance:

&nbsp;        Many industries have rules that require regular security updates. Proper patching helps organizations stay legally compliant. 



#### **Consequences of failing to apply patches regularly:**



1\. Hack into systems:
 
&nbsp;        Hackers can break into the systems by using the weak points. Once they enter they can take control of the computer, server, or network.



2\. Steal data:

&nbsp;        They can steal sensitive information like passwords, bank details or personal documents. This leads to data breaches, which can harm individuals or even entire companies.



3\. Install malware or ransomware:

&nbsp;        Hackers may install malicious software to spy on someone or damage their file.



If we ignore patches our system stays open to known attacks. Hackers often target unpatched systems because thay are easy to break into.

#### 

#### **Real life example:**

   

        A prominent real life example is the WANNACRY ransomware attack in 2017, which exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft windows for which a patch had already been released but was not applied by many organizations, leading to widespread infections across hundreds of thousands of computers globally.



&nbsp;       Ransomware is a type of malware that locks our computer or files and attacks for money to unlock them.

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;       WannaCry used a known vulnerability in Microsoft windows. Microsoft had already released a security patch to fix this weakness two months earlier. But many people and organizations did not update their systems with that patch. As a result, their computers were left unprotected.

#### 

#### **Best Practices for Patch Management:**

1\. Keep an inventory of all devices and software. Know what systems, applications, and devices you have. Helps identify what needs updates and patches.



2\. Regularly check for updates. Frequently look for new patches from software vendors. Subscribe to vendor notifications or use tools that alert you automatically.



3\. Create a patch schedule. Don’t delay updates. Apply critical patches as soon as possible and schedule routine updates (weekly or monthly).



4\. Test patches before full deployment. First, test patches on a few systems to make sure they don’t break anything. Especially important in large organizations.



5\. Automate when possible. Use patch management software or tools to scan, install, and track updates. Saves time and reduces human error.



6\. Prioritize critical security patches. Fix vulnerabilities that could lead to cyberattacks first. Use the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) to judge severity.



7\. Document everything. Keep records of what was patched, when, and by whom. Helps with audits and compliance.



8\. Backup before applying patches. Always create backups before patching. In case something goes wrong, you can restore your data.



9\. Train your team. Make sure IT staff and users understand the importance of patching. Teach safe update practices.



10\. Review and improve regularly. Periodically review your patch management process. Look for ways to make it faster, safer, and more effective.



#### **Conclusion:**



           Patch management is a crucial part of cybersecurity that protects systems from known vulnerabilities. By regularly applying patches, testing updates, and automating the process where possible, organizations can prevent major cyberattacks and ensure their systems remain secure, stable, and up to date.

&nbsp;         It ensures that systems are updated with the latest security fixes, reducing the risk of exploitation through known vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks like WannaCry highlight the dangers of delayed patching, which can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and operational disruptions.

&nbsp;        

&nbsp;         An effective patch management strategy built on regular updates, thorough testing, clear policies, and automation helps organizations stay secure, compliant, and resilient against evolving cyber threats.
